        <p>You agree that damages for breach of this License are difficult to calculate accurately because of the negative impacts on our goodwill and reputation in the marketplace and with our Artists and therefore, you and we agree to fix as liquidated damages for breach of this License, and not as a penalty, an amount equal to $25,000 USD, plus our reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees and costs, which you and we agree represent damages actually sustained by us for your breach. These liquidated damages are meant to be and are cumulative of and in addition to our other remedies and you agree they are a reasonable measure of the harm that would be suffered by Licensor in addition to any damages owed by Licensee to Artists.</p>

        <p>This License: (a) contains the entire agreement between Licensor and Licensee and supersedes any prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof; (b) is severable; (c) may not be transferred or assigned by Licensee; (d) is binding on permitted successors and assigns; and (e) is governed by the law of the State of Washington (without regard to conflicts of law principles). Any dispute arising out of or relating to this License shall be commenced in the federal or state courts located in King County, Washington. In any such dispute, the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to its reasonable attorneys&apos; fees. No modification or waiver of this License will be binding unless made in a writing signed by Licensee and one of Licensor&apos;s duly authorized representatives. No failure by Licensor to exercise a right or remedy shall be deemed a waiver of any further right or remedy.</p>
