        <h5>You Are Responsible For Your Conduct</h5>

        <p>With respect to the Service, you are fully and solely responsible for (a) any activity that occurs under your screen name, password or account, including any violation of this Agreement, (b) your own conduct and your interactions with other users of the Service, and (c) any content, material or information that you upload, create, post, display, publish, e-mail, communicate, transmit or otherwise make available, or which you transmit to other Users (collectively, &quot;User Content&quot;).</p>

        <h5>Account</h5>

        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all actions taken in connection with it. You must not use your account in a misleading or unlawful manner. Audiosocket will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, deactivate, or terminate your account or your use of the Service at any time, and you may likewise terminate your account at any time. You agree to keep your password secure and confidential and not to disclose it to anyone and will not permit any third party to access your account.</p>

        <p>You are responsible to protect the confidentiality and safety of your account details (username and password) and for restricting access to your account. You accept full and exclusive responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.</p>

        <h5>Payments, Taxes, and Refund Policy</h5>

        <p>You will provide a credit card for all payments under this account (your &quot;Payment Method&quot;). You agree that you will pay for all content you license through Audiosocket and that Audiosocket may charge your Payment Method for the correct price of any content purchased or content downloaded and used without a proper license, including content used outside of the terms of service or license agreement, for any additional amounts (including any taxes and infringement fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. <strong>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING AUDIOSOCKET WITH A VALID PAYMENT METHOD AND UPDATES AS REQUIRED FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES.</strong></p>

        <p>In the event that content is used outside of The Terms of Service, or the license agreement, Audiosocket will contact you 15 days prior to charging your Payment Method for any payments due related to the misuse of content purchased or downloaded and used outside of the terms of the service or license agreement obtained. You will have 15 days to dispute the additional payment, at which time Audiosocket will provide a decision of any additional payments due.</p>

        <h5>Subscriptions</h5>

        <p>We offer part of the Services on a subscription-basis (&quot;Subscription&quot;). For the applicable length of your Subscription,  either some or all of the Audiosocket music library will be available to you for your licensing.</p>

        <p>All tracks that you license during your Subscription are: (i) for single use only (meaning that you&apos;ll need separate licenses if you wish to use a single track in multiple and separate audiovisual works); and (ii) subject to the licensing terms in your end user license agreement. In addition, the specific audiovisual work that the track will be incorporated with must be identified at the time you license the track.</p>

        <p>All tracks licensed with a Subscription are licensed for a perpetual term, so once you&apos;ve licensed a track and incorporated the track into an audiovisual work, that track is licensed for forever use (subject to your compliance with the license agreement) in that audiovisual work without additional sync fees.</p>

        <p>When you purchase a Subscription, you expressly agree that your Subscription will automatically renew for the applicable length of your Subscription until either you or Audiosocket cancels your Subscription. By way of example, if you buy a 1-year Subscription, your Subscription will automatically renew for another 1-year period.</p>

        <h5>Paying for Subscriptions:</h5>

        <p>The Subscription fee displayed at the time of purchase (&quot;Subscription Fee&quot;) will be charged to your Payment Method. You may either pay for an entire year of the  Subscription upfront or pay month to month.. If you choose to pay the Subscription Fee month to month, we will charge your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the day that you started the Subscription.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for paying the full Subscription Fee for your Subscription. If you fail to pay for any part of your Subscription Fee, then Audiosocket will terminate your Subscription and reserves the right to terminate your Audiosocket account. In addition: (i) all licenses that you obtain as part of your Subscription will terminate; (ii) you will be in violation of these Terms and Conditions of Use; and (iii) you may be subject to Audiosocket&apos;s standard license fees.</p>

        <h5>Canceling Subscriptions:</h5>

        <p>To stop automatic renewal of your Subscription, you must cancel your Subscription within 30 days before it automatically renews for another year. You may cancel your month to month Subscription at any time by managing your Subscription settings in your account.</p>

        <h5>All sales are final</h5>

        <p>Prices for products offered may change at any time, and Audiosocket does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering. In addition, all payments for Subscription Fees are final. No refunds will be given except in Audiosocket&apos;s sole and absolute discretion.</p>

        <p>You agree that damages for breach of these Terms of Service or any Audiosocket License are difficult to calculate because of the negative impacts on our goodwill and reputation in the marketplace and with our Artists and therefore, you and we agree to fix as liquidated damages for breach of this License, and not as a penalty, an amount equal to $25,000 USD, plus our reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and costs, which you and we agree represent damages actually sustained by us for your breach.
