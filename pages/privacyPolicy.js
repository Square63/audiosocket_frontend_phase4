If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h5>Personally Identifiable information</h5>
        <p>When you use certain portions of the Service, we may collect information that may be personally identifying. Personally identifying information means information that can be used to identify an individual, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, or Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Those who engage in transactions with Audiosocket—by registering for an account, for example—may be asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal information required to process those transactions. Audiosocket does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described in this Privacy Policy. You can always refuse to supply personally identifying information; however, this may prevent you from engaging in certain Service-related activities.</p>

        <h5>Non-personal information</h5>
        <p>Like most website operators, Audiosocket collects non-personal information such as [the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each user request.] Audiosocket collects this information to better understand how Audiosocket&apos;s users use the Service, and to provide our users with an enhanced experience. Audiosocket may disclose non-personal information in the aggregate, for instance, by sharing anonymized and aggregate non-personal information with third parties for research purposes.</p>

        <h5>Statistical information</h5>
        <p>Audiosocket may collect statistics about the behavior of users to the Service. For instance, Audiosocket may monitor the most popular parts of the Service, and log page views. Audiosocket may display this information publicly or provide it to others, for instance, to third parties for research purposes. However, Audiosocket does not disclose any personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h5>Cookies</h5>
        <p>Audiosocket uses cookies to help Audiosocket identify and track visitors, their usage of the Service, and their access preferences. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&apos;s computer, and that a visitor&apos;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers can set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Service; however, certain features of the Service may not function properly without cookies.</p>

        <h5>Security</h5>
        <p>You are responsible for keeping your account information and password secure.
